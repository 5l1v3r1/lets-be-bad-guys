    <p>It's often easy to forget to check that a user is authorized to view or
    manipulate some data.  A user profile page might be good about checking for
    the user to be signed in, but fail to verify that the user actually owns
    the data being presented or edited.</p>

    <p>Imagine you're logged on as a user with userid=1 and can access
    <a href="{% url 'direct-object-references-profile' '1' %}">your
    user profile</a>... What else can you do?</p>
