Shiny, Let's Be Bad Guys
========================

The Internet is a dangerous place, filled with evildoers out to attack your code for fun
or profit, so it's not enough to just ship your awesome new web app--you have to take the
security of your application, your users, and your data seriously.  You'll get into the
mindset of the bad guys as we discuss, exploit, and mitigate the most common web app
security flaws in a controlled environment.

This repository contains a deliberately-vulnerable website and exercises for learning
about different kinds of attacks.

We'll be using the [OWASP Top 10][top10] as our topic roadmap, addressing subjects such as:

 * Injection attacks
 * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
 * Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
 * Insecure Direct Object References
 * Insecure Cryptographic Storage
 * Failure to Restrict URL Access
 * Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards
 * Security Misconfiguration
 * Broken Authentication and Session Management
 * Insufficient Transport Layer Protection
